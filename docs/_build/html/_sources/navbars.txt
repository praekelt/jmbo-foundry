Navbars
-------

A navigation bar typically contains a small amount of items since horizontal
space is limited.  Each item in the navigation bar is represented as a `Link`.
A navbar can be published to certain sites.

A navbar with slug `main` is considered special. It is assumed to be the site
navbar by default.
